The value-criterion of utilitarianism (happiness) does not treat every person equally. Since maximizing happiness only focuses on the total happiness in a group of people, it would favor the people that could best convert resources into happiness. For example, imagine you have a group of people and some cookies. One person in the group just happens to love cookies more than everyone else and you know giving that person all the cookies would defintely maximize the total happiness of the group. If you try to maximize happiness, it would mean giving all the cookies to that person and giving nothing to the others. 

[ Real Life Example ]


This demonstrates that the criterion of maximizing happiness is not egalitarian and does not treat each person equally.
